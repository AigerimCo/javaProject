    /*
    Create a Java program that prompts the user to enter a date and time in the format of
    "MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm" and then calculates the number of minutes until the next full hour.
    The program should then print out the result in the format of (mm minutes until the next full hour".

    Example:

    Input:01/27/2022 14:32
    Output:28 minutes until the next full hour.

    Hint:

    1. Use theLocalDateTime class to parse the input date and time
    2. Use the withMinute() and withSecond() method to set the minute and seconds to zero
    3. Use the Duration class to calculate the difference between the input date and time and
    the next full hour date and time
    4. Use the toMinutes() method to get the number of minutes in the duration
