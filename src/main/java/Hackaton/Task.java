Problem: Grocery Store Management System
Create a grocery store management system using Java that allows users to:
1. Add and remove products from the store's inventory
2. Create and manage customer accounts
3. Keep track of customer purchases
4. Generate sales reports
5. Update the stock levels of each product based on customer purchases
Consider the following classes to start the project:
1. Product class to store information about each product in the store
2. Customer class to store information about each customer
3. Store class to manage the overall system, including the inventory and customer
accounts.
Additionally, use object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance,
polymorphism, and encapsulation where appropriate.
Classes:
1. Product Class:
• Fields: name, price, stockLevel
• Methods:
• constructor to initialize the product
• getName() to return the name of the product
• getPrice() to return the price of the product
• getStockLevel() to return the stock level of the product
• setStockLevel() to update the stock level of the product
2. Customer Class:
• Fields: name, address, phone, list of purchased products
• Methods:
• constructor to initialize the customer
• getName() to return the name of the customer
• getAddress() to return the address of the customer
• getPhone() to return the phone number of the customer
• addPurchase() to add a product to the list of purchased products
• getPurchasedProducts() to return the list of purchased products
3. Store Class:
• Fields: name, inventory (list of products), customer accounts (list of
customers)
• Methods:
• constructor to initialize the store
• addProduct() to add a product to the inventory
• removeProduct() to remove a product from the inventory
• getInventory() to return the current inventory of the store
• addCustomer() to add a customer to the customer accounts
• removeCustomer() to remove a customer from the customer
accounts
• getCustomers() to return the current customer accounts
• generateSalesReport() to generate a report of total sales for the
store
• updateStockLevel() to update the stock level of the products based
on customer purchases
These classes and methods are just a suggestion, and you can add or modify them as
you see fit. The goal is to provide a foundation for you to build upon, encouraging you
to think critically and creatively about how to solve the problem
